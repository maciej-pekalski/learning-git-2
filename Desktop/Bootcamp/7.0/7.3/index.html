			<span>I was a P.F.C. on a search patrol, huntin' Charlie down
			It was in the jungle wars of '65
			My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone
			And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside
			Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
			And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
			And then a big Marine a giant, with a pair of friendly eyes
			Appeared there at my shoulder and said "Wait."

			When he came in close beside me, he said "Don't worry, son, I'm here
			If Charlie wants to tangle now, he'll have two to dodge"
			I said, "Well, thanks a lot!" I told him my name and asked him his
			And he said "The boys just call me Camouflage"<br>

			Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
			Things are never quite the way they seem
			Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
			I was awfully glad to see this big Marine</span>

			Well, I was gonna ask him where he came from, when we heard the bullets fly
			Comin' through the brush, and all around our ears
			It was then I saw this big Marine light a fire in his eye
			And it was strange, but suddenly, I forgot my fears

			Well, we fought all night, side by side, we took our battle stance
			And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
			'Cause they seemed to go right through him just as if he wasn't there
			And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran
			And it was near the riverbank when the ambush came on top of us
			And I thought it was the end, and we were had
			Then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin' through a bush
			And that big Marine, he just swat it with his hand
			Just like it was a fly...<br>

			Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
			Things are never quite the way they seem
			Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
			This was an awfully strange (big) Marine

			<span>When he led me outta danger I saw my camp and waved goodbye
			He just winked at me from the jungle and then was gone
			When I got back to my H.Q., I told 'em about my night
			And the battle I'd spent with a big Marine named Camouflage
			When I said his name, the soldier gulped, and a medic took my arm
			And led me to a green tent on the right
			He said "You may be tellin' true, boy, but this here is Camouflage
			And he's been right here since he passed away last night
			In fact, he's been here all week long...
			But before he went, he said Semper Fi, and said his only wish
			Was to save a young Marine caught in a barrage
			So here, take his dog tag, son, I know he'd want you to have it now"
			And we both said a prayer for a big Marine named Camouflage
			
			So next time you're in a jungle fight, and you feel a presence near
			Or hear a voice that in your mind will lodge
			Just be thankful that you're not alone and you've got some company
			From a big Marine the boys calls Camouflage.
			
			Hup, hey-ho, hey, left... left...</span><br>
			<span>Woah, woah, Camouflage
			Hey, hey-ho, ho, left... left...
			Woah, woah, Camouflage
			repeat endlessly until fade...</span>
