	I was a P.F.C. on a search patrol, huntin' Charlie down
	It was in the jungle wars of '65
	My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone
	And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside
	Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
	And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
	And then a big Marine a giant, with a pair of friendly eyes
	Appeared there at my shoulder and said "Wait."

	When he came in close beside me, he said "Don't worry, son, I'm here
	If Charlie wants to tangle now, he'll have two to dodge"
	I said, "Well, thanks a lot!" I told him my name and asked him his
	And he said "The boys just call me Camouflage"

	Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
	Things are never quite the way they seem
	Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
	I was awfully glad to see this big Marine
