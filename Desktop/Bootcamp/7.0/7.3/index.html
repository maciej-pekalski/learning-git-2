	I was a P.F.C. on a search patrol, huntin' Charlie down
	It was in the jungle wars of '65
	My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone
	And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside
	Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
	And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
	And then a big Marine a giant, with a pair of friendly eyes
	Appeared there at my shoulder and said "Wait."

	When he came in close beside me, he said "Don't worry, son, I'm here
	If Charlie wants to tangle now, he'll have two to dodge"
	I said, "Well, thanks a lot!" I told him my name and asked him his
	And he said "The boys just call me Camouflage"

	Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
	Things are never quite the way they seem
	Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
	I was awfully glad to see this big Marine

	Well, I was gonna ask him where he came from, when we heard the bullets fly
	Comin' through the brush, and all around our ears
	It was then I saw this big Marine light a fire in his eye
	And it was strange, but suddenly, I forgot my fears

	Well, we fought all night, side by side, we took our battle stance
	And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
	'Cause they seemed to go right through him just as if he wasn't there
	And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran
	And it was near the riverbank when the ambush came on top of us
	And I thought it was the end, and we were had
	Then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin' through a bush
	And that big Marine, he just swat it with his hand
	Just like it was a fly...

	Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
	Things are never quite the way they seem
	Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
	This was an awfully strange (big) Marine
